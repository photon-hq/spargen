//! # Subsystem: surface
//! layer-deps: ir, name
//!
//! The **consumer-visible API surface** of generated output, and semver-impact diffing between two
//! surfaces. This is a pure analysis subsystem: it reads a lowered [`Api`](crate::ir::Api) plus its
//! allocated [`Names`](crate::name::Names) and models exactly what a *consumer* of the generated
//! client sees — the client methods (operations) and the public model types — then classifies every
//! difference between an old and a new surface as a semver bump. It never emits code and has no
//! effect on generation or the runtime; it backs `spargen diff`.
//!
//! Per the product contract, "the semver surface is the public API of generated output".
//!
//! ## Canonicalisation
//!
//! Two specs assign different (opaque) [`TypeId`](crate::ir::TypeId)s to structurally identical
//! types, so types cannot be compared by id. Every type reference is instead rendered to a *stable
//! structural string* by [`canon_ty`]:
//!
//! * primitives → their canonical scalar label (`String`, `i32`, `i64`, `f64`, `bool`, `Uuid`,
//!   `DateTime`, `Date`) — independent of the `uuid`/`time` feature flags, which only change the
//!   concrete Rust type, not the surface identity;
//! * a **nominal** type — a `struct`, a string `enum`, or a union (the models a consumer names,
//!   constructs, and matches) → its generated type name;
//! * an array → `Vec<inner>`, a tuple → `(a, b, …)`, bytes → `Bytes`, an untyped node → `Value`;
//! * an integer/boolean scalar `enum`/`const` (which generates a `pub type X = i64`/`bool` alias,
//!   carrying no consumer-facing structure beyond its scalar) → that scalar;
//! * a nullable reference wraps the above in `Option<…>`.
//!
//! `boxed` is *not* rendered: boxing is an internal cycle-break artifact, not a surface distinction.
//! Because nominal types render by name (never expanded in place), rendering always terminates, and
//! each nominal type is compared once, as its own surface entry.
