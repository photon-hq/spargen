Generating from a test, a wrapper binary, or a script leaves nothing to audit, so the contract is unverified and a missing dependency surfaces later as a compile error in the generated module instead of a spargen diagnostic. Run `spargen deps <spec>` to print the exact `[dependencies]` block that spec requires, or generate from a build script so the audit runs automatically. Set `CargoIntegration::Off` if this generation is deliberately not part of a Cargo build."

Neither is an error — generating outside a build script is a legitimate thing to do — but both are silent by nature, which is why they are reported. Call `generate` from a `build.rs` to get both, or declare the intent with `CargoIntegration::Off` to accept them silently."

This is an error rather than a warning purely because the caller asked for it: `Required` exists for builds where a missed rebuild trigger would ship a client generated from a stale spec. Move the call into a `build.rs`, or relax to `CargoIntegration::Auto` (degrade with `W013`/`W012`) or `CargoIntegration::Off` (degrade silently)."

A serde `rename` is format-agnostic — it would also rewrite the JSON wire names — so `xml.name`/`xml.attribute` are NOT applied to a schema that is also reachable from a JSON/form/multipart/text body, a response, or a parameter (or that is not used as an XML body at all); the field keeps its normal wire name and this warning fires, so JSON is never corrupted. The `xml.namespace`, `xml.prefix`, and `xml.wrapped` (wrapped arrays) hints are never represented — quick-xml serde has no faithful mapping for them — so they are always ignored with this warning rather than silently honored or rejected."
